# WiFi Energy Monitor for electromechanical induction watt-hour meters ('Ferraris-Zähler')

This project contains a firmware and schematic for a WiFi based Energy Monitor which can be connected to a
electromechanical induction watt-hour meters ('Ferraris-Zähler') using the
[ELV Sensor ES-Fer](https://www.elv.de/homematic-zaehlersensor-ferraris-zaehler-es-fer.html), which is normally intended
to be used with the HomeMatic ecosystem. Using the transmission board described here, the sensor data is made available via
WiFi and http RESTfull API. This way it can be used in many other scenarios outside HomeMatic (e.g. Node-Red).

An ESP8266 ESP-12E NodeMcu WiFi board is used for connectivity and sensor evaluation.

## Usage

### REST-API

The board has a RESTfull http interface which returns all data as json objects.
There is an API description in [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) format in the folder `api`.
It is recommended to use the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to open and view the API documentation.
The editor also allows you to generate client code to access the API from the runtime/language of your choice.

Here is also a short summary:

<table><tr><td>Path</td><td>Method</td><td>Summary</td></tr><tr><td>/info</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets info about board and system status.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets the energy meters.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/counters</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets the counters of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/counters/{idCounter}</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets a single counter of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/counters/{idCounter}/kWh</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets the kilowatt-hour of a counter of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/counters/{idCounter}/kWh</td><td>PUT</td><td>Set the kilowatt-hour counter of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/counters/{idCounter}/revolutions</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets the number of revolutions of the disc of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/counters/{idCounter}/revolutions</td><td>PUT</td><td>Set the number of revolutions of the disk of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/revsPerKWh</td><td>PUT</td><td>Sets the number of revolutions per kilo watt-hour.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/revsPerKWh</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets the number of revolutions per kilo watt-hour.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/threshold</td><td>PUT</td><td>Sets the threshold for the sensor of an energy meter.</td></tr><tr><td>/meters/{idMeter}/threshold</td><td>GET</td><td>Gets the threshold for the sensor of an energy meter.</td></tr></table>

## Build instructions

### Hardware

You can find a [fritzing](http://fritzing.org) schematic in the folder `hardware` which shows the pin layout.

### Firmware

To build the arduino sketch:

- Install Arduino IDE
  - Use the Arduino Board Manager to install the ESP8266 toolchain (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
  - Use the Arduino Library Manager to install ArduinoJSON (https://bblanchon.github.io/ArduinoJson/)
- Open the sketch and modify the settings in the `config.h` header. You have to set the SSID and password of your wifi network.
- Compile and download to nodemcu.
